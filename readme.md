# Introduction

This is the technical interview exercise only.

# How to start?

## Local dev environment
1. Start the `EventsTracker.Api` project from Visual Studio by using `launchSettings.json`, so the API starts with the already configured port.
2. Open cmd in the root folder of `EventsTracker.Web` project
3. Execute `npm run start`
4. Open the app in a browser: `https://localhost:3000`

That's it!
